# Go Algorithm API

This repository is a collection of algorithms written in go, served through an API.

## Building

```bash
$ go build
$ ./algo-api
```

## Benchmarking

Create a Benchmark file with the filename xxx_test.go, and function name BenchmarkXXXX in bench/.

```
$ go test -bench=BenchmarkXXXX -benchmem -cpuprofile profile.out
$ go tool pprof profile.out
(pprof) top
```

The -memprofile and -blockprofile flags can also be used in `go test` to generate memory allocation and blocking call profiles.
